always at least 2 items when dragging by design.

drag semantics: drag onto something means put it where that one is, and move the rest forward. 

if 2:
    if dragging first and target is the task list wrapper space after the tasks, drop ok.
    otherwise, no change.

if > 2:
    
    get drop index: the target's app-task-list parent's index in app-task-lists.

    dropping on another task:
        splice rest of tasks into starting index of one above drop target index.
        assign src to drop dest.
        splice out src.

    dropping at end of list:
        push src to end of list
        splice src from location
