1. input focus event - bug in chrome ios, virtual keyboard not active
2. after going to settings and back: can't add tasklists [map.js:299 Uncaught Error: can.Map: Object does not exist].
3. markdown export failing. 'get' on store is undefined.
4. tasklist data not saving
5. overflow - the event triggering this detection isn't getting i.fa fa-trash clicks.
6. fix add task button css 
7. theme data persistent in local storage but not live bound throughout templates. probably not propagating up from settings to app level data.
REASON: might be due to the lack of persistence of app container between views.
8. box shadow on task list not working with expanded.
9. Drag and Drop: dragging any element twice removes it. also, renaming a task after dragging it reveals that i've copied a task map, not rearranged them (in task_list draggable/droppable events).
